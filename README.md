# Pretrained-Model-cotton-disease
# Cotton Disease Prediction using Pretrained Models

🌱 A deep learning project to predict **cotton plant diseases** using pretrained models like **ResNet-50**, **VGG16**, and **EfficientNetB0**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying diseases in cotton plants through images.  
By leveraging powerful **pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, we ensure high accuracy even with limited training data.

The models used are:
- **ResNet-50**
- **VGG16**
- **EfficientNetB0**

## 📚 Libraries and Frameworks

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional, for image handling)

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Cotton Disease Dataset** (public dataset / custom dataset)

Dataset classes typically include:
- Diseased Cotton Leaf
- Diseased Cotton Plant
- Fresh Cotton Leaf
- Fresh Cotton Plant

*(You can update this if you used a specific dataset from Kaggle, etc.)*
